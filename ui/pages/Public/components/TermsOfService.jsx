    The Centre for Computational Medicine (CCM) is a Core Facility within The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids)
    Research Institute. Our mission is to provide the scientists and clinicians at SickKids with computational
    expertise, including high performance computing resources, bioinformatics analysis consulting, and software
    development. For more information on the organization,
    please see <a href="https://ccm.sickkids.ca/">https://ccm.sickkids.ca.</a>

    These Terms of Service apply to the CCM-seqr platform (&quot;Platform&quot;), a web application developed by
    the Broad Institute and hosted by the CCM for researchers at SickKids. The CCM-seqr platform is used by
    CCM employees and researchers at SickKids for rare disease genomic analysis and project management.

    These Terms of Service (&quot;Terms&quot;) are a legally binding agreement between you (the &quot;user&quot;),
    a CCM-seqr user, and the CCM-seqr platform (&quot;CCM-seqr&quot; or &quot;us&quot; or &quot;our&quot; or
    &quot;we&quot;) and govern your use of all the genomic and phenotypic information, data, reports, software,
    and communications that we make available to you (&quot;Data&quot;). These Terms also govern all services we may
    provide through any of our web applications that we refer to as CCM-seqr (&quot;Services&quot;).

    <Header content="Protected Health Information, and the Clinical Compliance Features" size="medium" />
    CCM-seqr is not intended for the storage of any PHI on the platform. You agree to indemnify and hold harmless
    CCM-seqr of and from any and all claims, demands, losses, causes of action, damage, lawsuits, judgments, including
    attorneys&apos; fees and costs, arising out of or relating to your uploading, storing, or transferring of PHI.

    <Header content="Restrictions on the Use of Shared and Group Accounts" size="medium" />
    You may not access CCM-seqr using group or shared accounts. The credentials used for authenticating to CCM-seqr
    must belong to a single individual.

    <Header content="Access Levels" size="medium" />
    Your level of access to systems and networks owned by the CCM is limited to ensure your access is no more than
    necessary to perform your legitimate tasks or assigned duties. If you believe you are being granted access that you
    should not have, you must immediately notify <a href="mailto:ccm.contact@sickkids.ca">ccm.contact@sickkids.ca.</a>

    <Header content="Granting Access" size="medium" />
    Some CCM-seqr users may have the ability to grant access to projects and the data contained therein. These users are
    responsible for ensuring that permission is granted only to those who have adequate permissions to work with that
    data. If data are shared inappropriately or with unauthorized users through CCM-seqr, your access to CCM-seqr may be
    suspended or terminated and, in some instances, CCM staff may contact the user&apos;s institution.

    <Header content="Termination of Use" size="medium" />
    We may in our sole discretion suspend/terminate your access to CCM-seqr without notification. We may also
    periodically review and remove accounts for which a user has not logged on.

    <Header content="External Links" size="medium" />
    CCM-seqr provides links that are maintained or controlled by external organizations. The listing of links are not an
    endorsement of information, products, or services, and do not imply a direct association between the CCM and the
    operators of the outside resource links.

    <Header content="Content" size="medium" />
    By accessing CCM-seqr, you expressly consent to monitoring of your actions and all content stored within the
    Platform. We reserve the right to delete, move, or edit any data, which we consider to be unacceptable
    or inappropriate.

    <Header content="Publication Rules" size="medium" />
    If CCM-seqr enables a research publication, the authors must acknowledge CCM-seqr using the following wording:

    &quot;Genomic variant analysis was performed using the seqr instance hosted by the Centre for Computational
    Medicine, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada. This research was enabled in part by support provided by
    Compute Ontario (<a href="computeontario.ca">computeontario.ca</a>) and the Digital Research Alliance of Canada
    (<a href="alliancecan.ca">alliancecan.ca</a>).&quot;

    <Header content="Disclaimer of Warranty" size="medium" />
    You expressly understand and agree that your use of CCM-seqr, or any material available through it, is at your
    own risk. Neither the CCM nor its employees warrant that CCM-seqr will be uninterrupted, problem-free, free of
    omissions, or error-free; nor do they make any warranty as to the results that may be obtained from CCM-seqr.

    <Header content="Limitation of Liability" size="medium" />
    In no event will CCM, its affiliates or participating institutions, or their respective directors, officers,
    employees, faculty members or students be liable for any damages, include incidental, indirect, special,
    punitive, exemplary, or consequential damages, arising out of your use of or inability to use CCM-seqr,
    including without limitation, loss of revenue or anticipated profits, loss of goodwill, loss of data,
    computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other damages.

    <Header content="General Terms" size="medium" />
    These Terms are governed by the laws of the Province of Ontario (Canada). This agreement was drafted against
    the background of Ontario law and is to be interpreted in accordance with that law. Any disputes relating to
    these Terms or the CCM-seqr platform will be heard by courts the jurisdiction of the province of Ontario (Canada).

    If any of these Terms are deemed inconsistent with applicable law, then such term(s) shall be interpreted in
    accordance with law, and no other terms will be modified. If we choose not to enforce any of these Terms,
    we are not waiving any other rights pursuant to this agreement.

    These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and CCM-seqr and therefore supersede all prior or
    contemporaneous negotiations, discussions, representations, or agreements between you and CCM-seqr, about the
    use of the CCM-seqr and Data.

    The proprietary rights, disclaimer of warranties, indemnities, limitations on liability and general provisions
    of these Terms shall survive any termination of these Terms.
